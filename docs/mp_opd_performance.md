# MP-OPD performance diagnostics

## Company OOM recovery

New full alternating queues use B64/micro2/accumulation32 and M16/meta-micro4.
The queue forwards these immutable configuration fields to the launcher.
Use a new campaign directory; do not resume an old micro4 campaign with this
configuration. The historical synthetic micro4 result below did not establish
capacity for real company rollouts: cd1334e failed in the second-order inner
gradient with 168.29 GiB allocated. Micro2 is a memory mitigation, not yet a
verified real-data capacity or throughput result. Direct launcher defaults
remain micro4 for compatibility; long runs additionally allow (1,1) and (2,4).

Production defaults remain full student, B64/micro4/accumulation16 and
M16/meta-micro4. Do not use synthetic capacity results to increase an existing
campaign's microbatch or resume it under a different accumulation contract.

## Equivalent preprocessing

Span tables retain the same prefix-sum/subtraction operations, executed per
span length rather than per cell. Energy features transfer static metadata in
bulk. Teacher normalization groups equal token counts to preserve scalar-divide
rounding on CUDA. Metric finiteness checks use one host synchronization on the
healthy path and still identify the offending key on failure.

Full-meta releases consumed gradient tuples before subsequent forwards and
optimizer-expression temporaries before hypergradient replay. Existing Adam
moments no longer allocate unused zero-tensor defaults. No update order, LR,
clipping rule, partition rule or trainable parameter set changes.

Measured on B200/Torch 2.11.0+cu130 in Modal app
`ap-wcspuKaPW9RBKpWHJAgunK`, five repetitions after two warmups:

| Operation | Atoms | Original ms | Optimized ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Energy features | 400 | 41.48 | 0.508 |
| Energy features | 1000 | 103.80 | 1.000 |
| Span tables (L2) | 400 | 37.88 | 0.259 |
| Span tables (L2) | 1000 | 93.66 | 0.255 |

These isolated kernels matched bitwise; feature-to-energy gradients also
matched. These factors must not be reported as end-to-end speedups.

Expected atom rates now vectorize across destination atoms while retaining
each atom's original accumulation order and scalar-promotion rounding.
B200 app `ap-2naRkcVUscLPCyDy8zacah` measured 19.67 -> 0.121 ms (400 atoms)
and 48.91 -> 0.123 ms (1000 atoms). Forward results matched bitwise;
mixed-precision first/second derivatives matched within rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-6.

## Short batch trials

1. Try one or two updates per candidate; stop on OOM and release its process.
2. Measure ten updates for feasible candidates; exclude the first two from
   steady-state statistics. Expand to thirty only if throughput is unstable.
3. Compare step wall time, tokens/second, peak allocated/reserved VRAM and
   actual rollout lengths. A fixed 1024-token probe does not qualify 4096 tokens.
4. Re-run pause/resume checks for the chosen microbatch before a new campaign.

`run_single_gpu.py` accepts `MP_MICRO_TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE` (divisor of 64) and
`MP_META_MICRO_BATCH_SIZE` (divisor of 16) for diagnostic limits 1-30 only.
The immutable campaign launcher strips inherited MP flags and retains its
original recipe. Diagnostic options are recorded in the launch manifest.

`experiments/modal/full_meta_capacity_modal.py` reuses the lhtu05 Gemma asset
volume and pinned runtime. It bounds one container to 1500 seconds and stops
on non-OOM errors. `--steps 10 --batch 64 --micros 4` measures synthetic
student/meta computation; it deliberately excludes teacher, on-policy rollout,
MP partition DP and company SFT weights. It is NOT a matched campaign test.
Results use a unique `--run-id` under `remote_artifacts/`.

## Full-size synthetic results (2026-09-14 UTC)

On lhtu05 B200, at length 1024 and meta-micro4, student micro64 exhausted
memory, micro32 failed cuBLAS allocation, and micro16/8 exhausted memory.
Micro4 passed. Releasing temporary gradients reduced peak allocated memory
from 147.24 to 127.43 GiB in the two-inner-microbatch capacity test; first-step
meta NLL, energy delta and both gradient norms matched the prior result.

App `ap-nMsJ4LCAgMivZGtkiX76sk` completed ten synthetic B64/M16 updates with
student/meta micro4: median of steps 3-10 was 20.122 seconds, range
20.064-20.269 seconds, peak allocated 127.517 GiB, peak reserved 160.279 GiB.
Energy gradients were nonzero on all ten steps. No efficacy inference follows
from synthetic NLL decreasing. This does not establish capacity for longer
actual rollouts, larger meta microbatches, or end-to-end campaign throughput.

Production remains micro4. Larger microbatches are not qualified by these
results. Company input/checkpoint and exact resume qualification remain
necessary before adopting a newly benchmarked batch configuration.
